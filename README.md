Sorting Algos 101 is a visualization of sorting algorithms with additional explanations and pseudocode provided. Having struggled with understanding sorting algorithms myself, I created these visualizations to better understand them. You choose the size of the array of bars as well as the speed of the sorting algorithm, and then select which sorting algorithm to implement to sort the array. The list of choices so far are quick, merge, bubble, insertion, and selection; more will be added over time. During each sorting, the top navbar will contain very helpful information about the selected sort (see below for more info).

## Technologies
- Data Structures & Algorithms
- Javascript
- HTML5
- CSS3

## Features / Steps
- select size of array
- determine speed of sorting
- choose sorting algorithm
- the array will sort itself with selected algorithm

### Before sorting begins

## Explanations and Pseudocode
- once sorting begins, top navbar will display information on the chosen sorting algorithm
- info includes...
